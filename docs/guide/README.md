# Andes UI

Andes UI is a library which contains all the UI components defined with its functionality and tries to generate an unified design language along Mercado Libre.

From IT in conjunction with UX, we are looking forward to create conventions to refer to each component so everybody could understand and talks about the same.

As same as the previous UI lib, this is open source.

## Definitions

* Monomodule
* Each class has the prefix "Andes" or "andes" depending on the use case.
* Well defined and intuitive architecture.
* Has custom attributes that allows the devs specify the component they would like to use.
* Components can be used by XML or programmatically.
* Compatible with Jetpack Compose.
